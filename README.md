To shape the future, we need to teach the future.

By educating children from a young age about secure transactions, financial literacy, and web3, we can ensure that they come into the real world ready to make a change and prepared to start their lives.

## Next Steps

##Inspiration 
We all learn about the basic subjects, math, English, science and the arts in school which is instilled in our brain like the alphabet. However, there has been a lack of education and emphasis put on for personal finances during younger years of schooling, if not all. Hence, our web-app, GoodBank, aims to encourage children from a young age to be aware and mindful of their financial decisions, and manage their finances.

## What it does
GooseBank's main objective is to provide financial literacy to students grade 6-12 through simulated banking web-app used for their day-to-day transactions at school. 

## How we built it
We created the app using JavaScript, node.js, express.js, React.js, CockroachDB, Firebase, Scaffold-eth API

## Challenges we ran into
- Setting up the wallet for etherium (higher barrier of entry for Scaffold-eth but certain documentation helped)
- Connecting backend to frontend in time (many random Github and VS Code environment issues came up)
- Keeping the UI simplistic enough for students of any age to use (deciding what features to keep and which ones to not)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to integrate ETHglobal's Ethereum platform within our webapp as the main source of finance for young students as this approach will expose them to the world of crypto which would further interest students to use this app for other purposes such as crypto trading.  

## What we learned
This webapp gave us the opportunity to explore and use new tools we hadn't used before like CockroachDB and Scaffold-eth.

## What's next for GooseBank
In the future, GooseBank aims to:
- Add features to do taxes and more based on a level system (each school year is a different level) and as the student progresses, they unlock more features and learn more.
- Provide support for the impaired and improve accessibility in underfunded areas.
- Provide enough resources and support for people to manage 100% of their finances.
- Create our own crypto
